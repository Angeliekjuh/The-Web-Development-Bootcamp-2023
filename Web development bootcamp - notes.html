<h1>The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023</h1>

<p>These are my notes from The Web Developer Bootcamp 2023. These may look like a retro web design, but that's only because I haven't reached the CSS part of the course yet. I might even be able to add a real working search bar too! Not like that's gonna happen before I reach the Javascript part of the course...</p>

<h2>HTML: The Essentials</h2>

<hr>

<p>This is where my notes on the HTML: The Essentials section will appear.</p>

<h2>HTML: Next Steps & Semantics</h2>

<hr>

<p>This section will cover my notes on the HTML: Next Steps & Semantics part of the course. I might have to watch the videos again tomorrow and take some more notes.</p>

<!-- A block element will take up horizontal space. --> 

<h3>Block elements</h3>

<p>A block element will take up horizontal space (100% width). Paragraphs &lt;p&gt; and divs &lt;div&gt; are block elements.</p>

<!-- An inline element will take up vertical space. -->

<h3>Inline elements</h3>

<p>An inline element takes up vertical space and can be placed in a container, like a &lt;div&gt; . You can place an inline element, such as a span  &lt;span&gt; or an anchor inside a block element.</span></p>

<p>A div can be used to group different elements and style them using CSS. You can also use a span to add CSS styling. For example: when you want to highlight <b>important words</b> (without using the bold tag). I'm gonna fix that later. After learning CSS.</p>

<table>

    <thead>
        <th>block elements</th>
        <th>inline elements</th>
    </thead>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>paragraph</td>
            <td>span</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>div</td>
            <td>anchor</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>-</td>
            <td>image</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>

</table>

<h3>An Odd Assortment of Elements</h3>

<p>There's some more HTML elements that might come in handy:

<table>
    <theader>
        <th>HTML element</th>
        <th>HTML code</th>
    </theader>

    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Horizontal rule</td>
            <td>&lt;hr&gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Line Break</td>
            <td>&lt;br&gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Superscript</td>
            <td>&lt;sup&gt;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Subscript</td>
            <td>&lt;sub&gt;</td>
        </tr>

    </tbody>

</table>

<h4>Horizontal Rule</h4>

<p>A Horizontal Rule can be used to divide different sections on a page. Like you see on this page.</p>

<h4>Line Break</h4>

<p>You can use a Line Break to force a break. For example: you can use a line break when you're publishing a poem and want to control where each line breaks.</p>

<h4>Superscript</h4>

<p>You can use Superscript to add references to your website. You can use nested elements to add an anchor to a superscript, like you see on Wikipedia.</p>

<h4>Subscript</h4>

<p>You can also use the Subscript, even though it's not used often. You can use it to make fractions.</p>

<h3>Entity Codes</h3>

<p>You can use Entity Codes to display characters that normally would be invalid. For example: the copyright and trademark symbol.</p>

<p>There's also reserved characters in HTML. These are the characters that we use to write our HTML code. These reserved characters may cause issues in Visual Studio Code. This is why we use entity codes. You can find all entity codes on <a href="https://entitycode.com">this website</a></a> </p>

<h2>HTML Forms & Tables</h2>

<hr> 

<p>This is where my notes from the HTML Forms & Tables will go! After this... it's time to learn some CSS!</p>

<h3>HTML Buttons</h3>

A button inside a &lt;form&gt; will always automatically submit the form, unlesss you asign a different type to the button.
